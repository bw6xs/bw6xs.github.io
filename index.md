### Hey, welcome to my little corner of Github. 

I teach Urban + Environmental Planning at the University of Virginia. In addition to introductory data science with and emphasis on geospatial data and urban applications, I also teach a course in civic teachnology. 

I am in the process of fleshing out this site with more information related to ongoing and selected completed research projects, so stop by again soon!
